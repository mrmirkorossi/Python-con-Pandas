0,US,"Initially a rather subdued Frog; as if it has been tamed down. Then, suddenly, There's a plush core of blackberry fruit, and the classic Cayuse funkiness is there, drenched in liquid rocks and cured meat and drying tannins. It's all in proportion and a fine reflection of the steely vintage. As it opens gracefully you discover that it is a stunningly refined Frog, quite possibly the best ever; powerful and distinctive, but also elegant, feminine.",Cayuse,Syrah,Bionic Frog,2008,100,80.0
1,US,"In 2005 Charles Smith introduced three high-end Syrahs. In 2006 Smith has made a wine better than each of these, by combining them into a single wine—Royal City Syrah. Rich scents of purple fruit, smoked meat, cedar, lead pencil, moist earth and so on proclaim a wine with genuine gravitas. There is nothing missing, from the first sniff to the last sip, the wine delivers on all levels. Complex, beautifully balanced, powerful and detailed.",Charles Smith,Syrah,Royal City,2006,100,80.0
2,US,"Dark and concentrated, this sends up complex aromas saturated with tar, asphalt, ink, steel, smoke and charred barbecue. It's a beautiful wine, tight and textural, in perfect balance, with superb depth, precision and elegance. The most contemplative of a superb 2011 Cayuse lineup, this wine above all needs your full attention.",Cayuse,Syrah,En Chamberlin Vineyard,2011,99,75.0
3,US,"A stupendous Pinot Noir, showing how beautifully this vineyard performs in the remote Sonoma Coast above Fort Ross. Williams Selyem's last few vintages of Precious Mountain have been extraordinary, but this 2009 tops them all. The wine is as light as a feather in the mouth, modest in alcohol and delicately feminine, like pure satin. However, few Pinot Noirs in the world achieve this level of concentration. Wild raspberries and cherries, cola, sleek minerals, dusty baking spices and smoky oak combine for flavors that are utterly delicious. After all that, it possesses an indefinable attribute of fascination. Will age well for a long time, if you can keep your hands off it. Now–2021.",Williams Selyem,Pinot Noir,Precious Mountain Vineyard,2009,99,94.0
4,US,"This expresses the greatness of its vintage and vineyard, offering wave after wave of raspberry and cherry pie flavors, plus notes of red currant, sweet licorice, spicy Dr. Pepper and smoky sandalwood. There's also something exotically briary and wild that intrigues. Even more remarkable is the texture, an amalgam of acids and tannins that rivals any Pinot Noir ever produced in California. It should age for up to 20 years.",Williams Selyem,Pinot Noir,Hirsch Vineyard,2010,99,75.0
5,US,"In a vintage that produced the finest overall lineup of Cayuse wines to date, it may seem a little nit-picky to score some higher and some lower. But the En Chamberlin deserves first place again. Brilliant aromatics of smoked meat, bacon fat and otherworldly roasted accents seduce instantly. Once on the palate, the silky, balanced, near-perfect mix of umami and fruit, plus licorice, cassis, coffee liqueur and black tea notes suggest it's as decadent as it is delicious.",Cayuse,Syrah,En Chamberlin Vineyard,2009,99,75.0
6,US,"This is nearly perfect, a massive, monumental wine whose sheer power is matched only by its grace and refinement. The flavors of blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, buttered toast and cedar flood the mouth, tightly controlled by firm tannins and good acidity. Decant for several hours if you open it now, but better to give it 6–10 years in the bottle.",Trefethen,Cabernet Sauvignon,Reserve,2005,99,100.0
7,US,"Shows classic, full-throttle notes of tropical and citrus fruits, pears and sweet green apples, combined with strong minerality and complex layers of buttered toast, honey and creamy lees. The description alone hardly does justice to the wine's beauty. The acidity is perfect, the oak deftly applied, the finish long and completely satisfying. Winemaker Ehren Jordan suggests pairing it with simple fare like roast chicken and salted fingerling potatoes.",Failla,Chardonnay,Estate Vineyard,2010,99,44.0
8,US,"Sourced from Red Willow, Olsen and Les Collines, this is the finest effort yet from Gramercy Cellars and one of the greatest Syrahs ever produced in Washington state. Think Hermitage with brighter fruit. It's intensely aromatic, dense and seamless, stacked with rich flavors of mixed berries, layers of smoke, earth and herb, and punctuated by citrusy acidity. Highlights of oranges and tangerines sneak into the finish, which lingers for an astonishingly long time. Exceptional in every way.",Gramercy,Syrah,Lagniappe,2010,98,55.0
9,Italy,"Always the firm's showstopper and one of the best expressions of this celebrated vineyard, the 2013 doesn't disappoint. It opens with alluring scents of wild red berry, Alpine herb, truffle, graphite and new leather while the dazzling palate boasts Marasca cherry, clove, cinnamon, tobacco and a balsamic note. It already shows remarkable finesse and complexity but still needs years to develop to its full and impressive potential. Drink from 2025 through 2050.",Comm. G. B. Burlotto,Nebbiolo,Monvigliero,2013,98,70.0
10,France,"This is beautully concentrated and full of great richness yet seems closed at the moment. Its apricot jelly and dried fruit flavors, acidity and botrytis are in perfect balance, developing intensity as it opens. A full, generous wine with a great future. Drink from 2023.",Château Climens,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Bordeaux-style White Blend,2014,98,70.0
11,US,"With this wine, Dolce cements its status as California's most consistently great dessert wine. This year's blend is 80% Sémillon and 20% Sauvignon Blanc, and the grapes were infected with the botrytis, resulting in the fantastic sweetness. Devastating in apricot, orange, pear, honey, vanilla and créme brûlée flavors, in an unctuous, viscous texture, with wonderfully clean acidity, it's certainly one of the greatest sweet California wines in memory.",Dolce,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,2006,98,85.0
12,Italy,"Immensely inviting, this opens with fragrant pipe tobacco, crushed berry, new leather and pressed violet aromas. On the palate, firm, refined tannins underpin juicy black cherry, raspberry and cinnamon flavors, while orange zest accents and an energizing mineral note lift the finish. It's beautifully balanced with bright acidity and will reward a bit of cellaring. Drink 2020–2032.",Conti Costanti,Sangiovese,Sangiovese,2012,98,95.0
13,US,"A tremendous achievement in Merlot. The vineyard, around 1,600 feet up on Mt. Veeder, is now owned by the Jackson family, and the winemaker is Chris Carpenter, who oversees Cardinale. In fact, this Merlot bears an uncanny resemblance to Cardinale in the dramatically ripe, sweet fruit and superb, tannin-based structure. It's 100% Merlot, with hefty yet balanced alcohol, and the wine easily handles the 85% new French oak in which it was aged for 22 months.",Mt. Brave,Merlot,Merlot,2008,98,60.0
14,US,"In recent years, Precious Mountain Vineyard has provided Bob Cabral with some of his most glorious fruit. Tremendous in flash and depth, it offers compelling flavors of raspberry and cherry, accented by sweet, smoky oak. There's such complexity in the acid and tannin structure, and in the earthy, stony, spicy nuances, that you find something new to love with every sip. This masterpiece is fabulous now, and will develop bottle complexity over the next 15 years, at least.",Williams Selyem,Pinot Noir,Precious Mountain Vineyard,2010,98,94.0
15,Italy,"One of the best expressions from the classic Cannubi vineyard area, this fragrant red is all about finesse, opening with enticing scents of perfumed berry, iris, rose, chopped herb, baking spice and new leather. The vibrant palate boasts structure as well as an almost ethereal elegance, delivering succulent red cherry, crushed strawberry, cinnamon and licorice wrapped in refined tannins. Bright acidity lends impeccable balance. Drink from 2021 through 2043.",Brezza,Nebbiolo,Cannubi,2013,98,60.0
16,France,"A wine of architectural strength and classical proportions, this has straight lines that mark the packed, concentrated fruits, which are sustained by its tannins. This is certainly the best wine that Léoville-Poyferré has produced, sumptuous while so finely structured.",Château Léoville Poyferré,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,2010,98,92.0
17,US,"A subtle, complex, utterly distinctive mix of flavors, with opening streaks of butter cookie, then mushroom broth, tightly wound berry fruit, earthy coffee grounds and even darker streaks of espresso and smoke and licorice. It is deeply layered with flavors that just keep piling on. Amazing wine.",Cayuse,Syrah,En Cerise Vineyard,2008,98,70.0
18,US,"This is yet another stunning wine from this site, guided by the capable hands of Winemaker and Viticulturalist Bibiana González Rave, who has coaxed from it beguiling layers of complex concentration and sublime notions of tang and salt. The only white from a sea of Pinot Noir grown here, it speaks to what the extreme Sonoma Coast can bring to the variety—a celebration of lemon zest, crisp apple and brioche delicately wrapped in minerality.",Wayfarer,Chardonnay,Wayfarer Vineyard,2014,98,80.0
19,Italy,"This stunning wine opens with classic Nebbiolo aromas of new leather, rose, wild berry, crushed herb, dark spice and menthol. The palate is chiseled and loaded with finesse, doling out juicy red cherry, ripe strawberry, licorice and cinnamon flavors. It's structured with polished tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2023–2043.",Brovia,Nebbiolo,Garblèt Suè,2013,98,83.0
20,US,"This is a best barrel blend of Goldeneye's several vineyards. It takes its beautifully ripe fruit from Confluence and the tannins of The Narrows to yield a dry, densely constructed and moderately ageable wine of exceptionally high quality and appeal. Blackberries, blueberries, cherries and exotic spices characterize the flavors of this tremendous wine, one of the best of the vintage out of the Anderson Valley. Only 222 cases were produced.",Goldeneye,Pinot Noir,Ten Degrees,2007,98,100.0
21,US,"Pretty much as good as Napa Cabernet gets. Shows the blackberries, black currants, blueberries and spicy plums of Oakville and scads of spices, and the tannin-acid structure is, in a word, superb. The oak elaboration is just about perfect, adding a tasteful layer of smoky, buttered toast. The finish goes on and on.",Vine Cliff,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cabernet Sauvignon,2007,98,75.0
22,US,"Pretty as all get-out, this wine is a floral masterpiece—a study in coastal rose and forest scents with a counterpunch of white pepper that leaves one wanting more. Juicy raspberry, strawberry and tangerine flavors are seasoned in allspice and tobacco, the palate so beautifully delicate yet fully realized in savory complexity and length.",Williams Selyem,Pinot Noir,Coastlands Vineyard,2014,98,75.0
23,US,"So enormously delicious, it will be hard to keep from drinking this gorgeous Cabernet right away, and that's just fine. It's composed of the most intensly concentrated flavors of blueberries and blackberries—dense, pure and slightly heady with a liqueur-like alcohol. The tannins are classic Diamond Mountain, firm and minerally, while oak plays the perfect role of the buttered toast and sweetly charred supporting character. Despite its immediate attraction, it's best cellared for 6–8 years, at the very least. Fans of old Cabernets will still be loving it in 2029.",Von Strasser,Cabernet Sauvignon,Estate Vineyard,2009,98,70.0
24,US,"Seductively smooth and intriguingly aromatic, this blend of several knock-out vineyards along Westside Road—Allen, Bacigalupi, Bucher, Rochioli Riverblock and Williams Selyem Estate—is instantly delicious, sharing a concentration of cherry, strawberry and citrus that perfectly captures the essence of the fruit, accented by a tease of black tea. An earthy minerality wraps around dry, polished tannins, with a streak of just-right acidity, giving it a realm of juiciness and flavorful sophistication. Enjoy through 2023.",Williams Selyem,Pinot Noir,Westside Road Neighbors,2013,98,69.0
25,US,"There is something ethereal and beyond words about this wine, a full-bodied but never intrusive expression of spicy cinnamon, black pepper and wild pine that makes it a puzzle worth trying to solve. Fruit plays a part, though softly, eking out shadows of raspberry and just-picked strawberry atop smooth, silky tannins and a measured, seductive body. The finish recalls a clove cigarette enjoyed in the rain.",Williams Selyem,Pinot Noir,Coastlands Vineyard,2013,98,75.0
26,Australia,"Just a tiny serving of this dark nectar will last a long time. The malty, porter-ish aromas intrigue, followed by incredibly rich and syrupy flavors accompanied by mouthwatering acids and enormous peristence. Layers of complexity gradually unfold in the glass, revealing hints of honey, caramel and beguiling rancio notes.",R.L. Buller & Son,Tokay,Calliope Rare,0,98,86.0
27,US,"The second release of Figgins—a single wine produced by Leonetti's Chris Figgins—is astonishing. Tasted in a lineup of exceptional Walla Walla reds, it outshined them all. It's a sophisticated blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Merlot, from the Figgins Vineyard, with gorgeous aromas of flowers, spices and black fruits. Seamless and long, complex and forceful without being overpowering, it can stand alongside top tier Bordeaux costing four or five times as much.",Figgins,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Estate,2009,98,85.0
28,US,"The immediate impression is of savory umami aromas pierced with pine needle and sage highlights. Red and black licorice, along with sweet cured meats, bring complexity to fruit flavors of berry, cherry and plum. Toss in Provençal spices, coffee grounds and the classic Cayuse earthiness that continues through a deep, firm, beautifully defined finish. Drink now through 2030.",Cayuse,Syrah,En Cerise Vineyard,2011,98,75.0
29,US,"A stunning Pirouette—63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot, 9% Cab Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Full and magnificently rich, it is loaded with dense and thrilling fruit flavors of black cherry and cassis. A streak of iron and a hint of citrus keep the wine evolving through a long, beautifully balanced finish. Retasted after being open for 24 hours, the wine was as fresh and thrilling as on the first day.",Pirouette,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Red Wine,2008,98,50.0
30,US,"This glorious, evocative wine calls up a rich and sensuous catalog of scents and flavors. Black truffle, sea salt, clean earth, fungus, strawberry, liquid rocks, umami, tar...? the words pour out with each sniff and swallow. It's detailed, substantial and refined, gathering itself for a long, generous, captivating finish. Drink now through 2030.",Cayuse,Cabernet Sauvignon,Widowmaker En Chamberlin Vineyard,2011,97,90.0
31,US,"A spectacular Pinot, continuing a string of great vintages from this little vineyard. The year 2007 gave California supernaturally rich but balanced Pinot Noirs, and this is one of them. It's sensational, offering broad, exotic fruit flavors, pinpointed with exotic spices, and exquisitely highlighted with French oak. Truly fine, this small-production wine should age over the next 6–8 years.",Goldeneye,Pinot Noir,Confluence Vineyard,2007,97,75.0
32,France,"There is something incredibly fruity and simultaneously tart on the nose: It is reminiscent of honeyed deaf nettle blossom as well as passion fruit. Wet stone and lemon heighten these perceptions even more. The palate comes in with concentrated zestiness—there almost is a sobering edge of bitter pith that pulls us towards the earth while the soaring lemon and grapefruit notes lift towards the light. This is fruitful promise and airy spirit, earthy depth and boundless richness. All this comes as a bundled force of joy, freshness and utter pleasure. That beguiling, lemony wet stone appears again on the dry intense finish of this elixir-like wine which perhaps has not only captured the light of the sun but that of the stars, too. Drink 2022–2040.",Domaine Ostertag,Riesling,Muenchberg Grand Cru,2015,97,66.0
33,Austria,"Candied lime and lemon zest are bathed in the rich honey notes of full-blown botrytis. This lifted scent is more than heady and continues intensely on the lusciously sweet palate. Candied quince and mandarin peel run circles round honeycomb and apricot jam which swirls around your brain like a psychedelic dream in all its apricot glory. There is something otherworldly about this wine, something ambrosial and decadent, made all the more so by its apparent weightlessness. What a triumph.",Kracher,Scheurebe,Trockenbeerenauslese Nummer 5 Zwischen den Seen,2013,97,95.0
34,US,"This is really a spectacular wine. It's hard to say why it's so superior to Krutz's 2005 bottling, but it's richer and more elegant in every respect. Combines immense power with great finesse. The refined essence of blackberries, black currants and spices thrills the palate, accented with the most beautiful coating of smoky oak. A great achievement that should develop in the bottle through 2018.",Krutz,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stagecoach Vineyard,2006,97,70.0
35,France,"The balance between ripeness and acidity that is the hallmark of this fine vintage is expressed well in this impressive wine. Tangy, with a strong streak of minerality, it is crisp and rich at the same time. For its fruitiness, it is ready to drink; for more maturity, it will need to age until 2018.",Taittinger,Champagne Blend,Millésimé Brut,2008,97,95.0
36,Portugal,"This wine is dominated by Touriga Nacional, which offers a backbone of dark tannins that gives it a firm structure and will allow it to age for many years. Produced in open stone lagares, it has richness and impressive opulence in black fruit tones that are cut by juicy acidity. Drink from 2022.",Quinta do Vale Meão,Portuguese Red,Red,2013,97,100.0
37,Italy,"Here's another stunning offering from this fantastic estate. Elegant, structured and restrained, it opens with enticing Nebbiolo scents of blue flower, perfumed berry, dark spice and a light balsamic note of eucalyptus. The luminous palate delivers juicy red cherry, raspberry, licorice and cinnamon while vibrant acidity and firm, polished tannins provide seamless support. Drink 2023–2043.",Brovia,Nebbiolo,Rocche di Castiglione,2013,97,96.0
38,Portugal,"The estate wine from Mouchão is always a great wine. This latest release, almost black in color and five-years-old, is hugely rich, powered by black fruits and juicy acidity. Made principally from Alicante Bouschet, it shows the power and the aging potential of this variety in the Alentejo. This wine, foot-trodden in open stone lagars, is destined for much longer aging. Drink at the earliest in 2021.",Mouchão,Portuguese Red,Red,2012,97,75.0
39,France,"An earthy touch of freshly turned soil clings to the pure apple note on the nose. On the absolutely dry palate, however, a beautifully lithe, serene but all-encompassing cloud of lemon freshness just steals the show. It pervades and informs nose, palate and mind. Its luminosity and vivacious freshness just soars and sings. Yes, this is uncompromising. You have to like freshness, acidity and unflinching honesty to be a fan of this, but if you are, this is a ticket to vinous heaven. Wow. This is a real experience and a celebration of site and variety. Hoard this if you can. Gorgeous and fresh now, but far too young. Drink 2022–2040.",Trimbach,Riesling,Schlossberg Grand Cru,2014,97,100.0
40,US,"The fragrance is almost otherworldly; sweet, dense and lightly lifted. This is a sinewy wine, that begins with compact power and focused, tart red fruits—predominantly raspberry and currant. At first juicy and tart, with hours of breathing time the wine broadens out into a wider spectrum of Cabernet fruits; cassis, blackberry and black cherry.",Betz Family,Cabernet Sauvignon,Père de Famille,2005,97,55.0
41,Hungary,"This ethereal Tokaji Aszú is golden in color, with aromas of delicate acacia flower, honeysuckle, fresh peach and tinned apricot. The flavors come alive on the palate, showing luscious apricot, floral honeycomb and fresh pear juice. The acidity is perfectly balanced to prevent this delightful wine from being too cloying.",Royal Tokaji,White Blend,6 Puttonyos Aszú Gold Label,2013,97,80.0
42,France,"A supremely integrated wine, its richness and beautiful fruit just part of a story that starts with intense aromas and segues on the palate into a balance of tannins, dark red fruits, enveloping acidity and a beautifully orchestrated finale of berries, spice and aching freshness.",Louis Jadot,Pinot Noir,Pinot Noir,2005,97,95.0
43,France,"Powered by intense botrytis, this wine is opulent and ripe, with spice, yellow fruit and honey flavors. It has just the right balance of acidity to maintain its shape and proportions. It's likely to age well over many years. Drink from 2024.",Château Coutet,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Bordeaux-style White Blend,2014,97,45.0
44,Italy,"Underbrush, dark-skinned berry, chopped mint and cooking spice aromas lead the way on this fabulous, structured wine. The full-bodied palate delivers a juicy core of ripe black cherry while white pepper, cinnamon, dried herb and a balsamic note provide the backdrop. Firm but refined tannins and fresh acidity provide balance and support. Drink 2018–2030.",Gianni Brunelli,Sangiovese,Riserva,2010,97,100.0
45,France,"The heady aromatic scent of fresh tangerine peel takes turns with the refreshing perfume of green Seville oranges. The palate takes these enticing aromas and bundles them into one arrow-like force of concentrated freshness. This is a high-wire act of piercing brightness and layered citrus aroma. This is like a self-generating well of freshness that convinces with its luminosity, raciness and rapier-like purity of citrus flavors. Everything is heightened: Fruit, dryness, freshness and vibrant verve. It is tempting but it would be a shame to drink this now. Keep this genie in its bottle for a while longer, if only to see what fascinating direction it takes. This is wondrous. Drink 2022–2037.",René Muré,Riesling,Clos Saint Landelin Vorbourg Grand Cru,2015,97,50.0
46,US,"Expressive in oak, earth and clove with cinnamon-cola, this savory, complex wine is also impressive in its ability to offer crisp and focused lines of citrus and fresh-picked raspberry. It teeter-totters the variety's ability to be both fruit-forward and elusively hard to reach. Streaks of thyme and rosemary figure into the mix. Drink now through 2023.",Williams Selyem,Pinot Noir,Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard,2013,97,79.0
47,Italy,"Perfumed and elegant, this opens with enticing scents of rose, violet, fragrant berry, baking spice, tilled earth and a hint of new leather. The delicious, silky palate is loaded with finesse, offering juicy wild cherry, cinnamon, chopped mint, black tea and a note of pipe tobacco. It's already drop-dead gorgeous but will develop more complexity over the next several years. Enjoy through 2026.",Le Potazzine,Sangiovese,Sangiovese,2011,97,70.0
48,US,"Winemaker Matthias Pippig brings Syrah to a whole new level with this stunningly dramatic bottling. Don't worry about the California appellation, a peculiarity of the winery's ownership. It's made entirely from Santa Barbara grapes, namely from Watch Hill in Los Alamos and Bien Nacido in Santa Maria Valley. The intensity of fruit defies description. It suggests enormous blackberry and creamy-sweet chocolate, larded with bacon and sprinkled with black pepper—and that doesn't even begin to describe the toasty sweetness of the 100% new oak barrels. This is the best California Syrah of the vintage, and one of the greatest Syrahs the state has ever produced. This opulence comes at a cost, however: The alcohol is high.",Sanguis,Syrah,Six White Horses,2009,97,75.0
49,US,"This shows the trifecta of winemaker Ehren Jordan's deft hand, the fabulous Hirsch Vineyard and the wonderful 2010 vintage. Even if you knew nothing of the wine's pedigree, you'd be dazzled by its sheer richness of raspberry, cherry, cola and herb flavors, plus the firm, stone-driven minerality, the dryness, the feral mountain hints, the acidity and the overall dazzling structure. The alcohol level is comparatively restrained, providing just the right touch of warmth. New oak clocks in at only 30%, imbuing the wine with a nice seasoning of smoke. Definitely worth searching for, but only 375 cases were produced. Drink this wine now–2022.",Failla,Pinot Noir,Hirsch Vineyard,2010,97,70.0
